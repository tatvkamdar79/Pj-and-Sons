          These products find a greater demand and market in Oil & Gas, Chemical
          and Petrochemical industries as they were flourishing and expanding
          the operations worldwide. The stainless steel gauge, gas filled
          thermometers & bi-metal thermometers were added in to manufacturing in
          1990s' to enable to serve the market in a wider manner.

          and meeting the EU regulations for specific industries has done in the
          2000s'. Technical expertise is always a plus point for ITEC. With
          sales increasing, the need to have the vendor registration with major
          oil & gas, Chemical & Petrochemical become a necessity, hence ITEC
          started the process of vendor listing with various worldwide oil & gas
          firms in 2000s' and listed as well and going on as a continuous.

          In 2011, ITEC expanded its operation into India with JV forming with
          the Bhimani family to set-up ITEC Measures Pvt. Ltd. This enabled ITEC
          to expand its product portfolio with RTD/Thermocouples/Thermowells,
          Pressure/Temperature switches and Level Switches/Instruments. The
          manufacturing plant is located in Vapi, Gujarat almost 150 km from
          heart of Mumbai. The firm as like its Italian counterpart also an ISO
          9001: 2008 company. The factory set-up has a total built-up area of
          25,000sqm. with most modern CNCs and testing facilities for the
          machining and testing of the in house manufactured instrument. As part
          of the continuous improvement derivatives, the management of ITEC has
          decided in perusing the ISO 14001 & OHSAS 45001 certifications to have

          Customization is one of the principles ITEC believes in. This drives
          us to develop many innovative designs during our 25 years of span in
          the industry. Some of them are: the diaphragm seals for very low
          pressure applications, external zero adjustment facility in pressure
          gauges , differential pressure instruments, which helps our customer
          the easy correction of reading in filled case gauges, differential
          pressure measurement up to 40 bar and differential pressure gauges
          with static up to 400 bar also applied on single side.

          industries across Europe. These services include tailor-made product
          solutions and private labeling of the standard product it manufacture.
          ITEC engineering teams (Italy & India) work hand-in-hand to meet the
          customization of the product and come out with most economic and
          technically compatible solution for the OEM industries, such as the
          bayonet type thermocouple or for the bearing temperature RTDs for the
          power generators or the gold plated diaphragm seals for the Petroleum
          industry. And in the end, as our tagline, we are ITECâ€¦ measuring with
